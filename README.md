# Bugz Broz 4

    "It's a Bugz Lyfe"

Two brothers, in a house.... and then a meteor hits and they ran as fast as 
they could until they got attacked by giant **Bugz**, enlarged from a nuclear
accident. Like really big bugs, like bigger than they are. Then things got
knocked into **12th gear**... You bet your bottom dollar that these brothers 
know how to handle business. It's like an apocalypse land, with big bugs and 
hazards and stuff, and cool weapons and traps and things to rig up in buildings 
so you can defend yourselves. But let's get back to the brothers, because you 
know they have a strong bond.
