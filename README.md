# Bugz Broz 4

    "It's a Bugz Lyfe"

Two brothers, in a house.... and then a meteor hits and they ran as fast as 
they could until they got attacked by giant **Bugz**, enlarged from a nuclear
accident. Like really big bugs, like bigger than they are. Then things got
knocked into **12th gear**... You bet your bottom dollar that these brothers 
know how to handle business. It's like an apocalypse land, with big bugs and 
hazards and stuff, and cool weapons and traps and things to rig up in buildings 
so you can defend yourselves. But let's get back to the brothers, because you 
know they have a strong bond.

Join Maximiliano and his brother Luciano in:

    Bugz Broz 4: Apocalypse now with nuclear accidents and really big bugs...

## How do I Hack on this Thing

Bugz Broz 4 is written in [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org) on top of the 
[Love2D](https://love2d.org) game engine. A compatible distribution of Fennel 
is already included in this repository, but you will need to download and
install Love2D for your platform.

### Running the game

To run the game, navigate to the repo and run the following command:

```
love .
```

This will open the game window and start a fennel REPL in your console
window.

### Hot Reloading

Once you have the game running and a REPL open, you'll want to use the awesome
`,reload` command to "hot reload" modules without restarting the game.

For example, if you wanted to reload the main `game.fnl` module, you would
simply call the following in your REPL:

```
,reload main
```
